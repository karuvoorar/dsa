# 2D Arrays

---

## Overview

2D arrays form the foundation for solving a wide range of interview problems — including **matrix manipulation**, **graph traversal**, and **dynamic programming on grids**.  
If you master these patterns, you can confidently solve matrix-based questions.

This guide helps you understand core concepts, identify problem patterns, and apply them effectively — all in one structured roadmap.

## Core Foundations

### **Topics**
* Declaration and initialization (`int[][] arr = new int[3][4];`)
* Accessing elements (`arr[i][j]`)
* Reading and writing data
* Row-wise and column-wise traversal
* Basic operations (sum, transpose, reverse)

### **Why It Matters**
These are the building blocks of every matrix problem.  
Many candidates struggle with advanced problems because they lack confidence in simple index manipulation.

### **Practice Problems**
1. Print a 2D matrix row by row  
2. Print a 2D matrix column by column  
3. Transpose a matrix  
4. Reverse rows or columns of a matrix

## Traversal Patterns

### **Topics**
* Diagonal traversal  
* Spiral order traversal  
* Wave traversal  
* Boundary traversal  

### **Why It Matters**
Traversal patterns test your control over loops and index handling.  
These same ideas appear in higher-level problems like image rotation or graph exploration.

### **Practice Problems**
1. Spiral Matrix – *LeetCode #54*  
2. Wave Print – *GeeksforGeeks*  
3. Diagonal Sum – Custom practice

## Searching and Manipulation

### **Topics**
* Search in a sorted matrix  
* Rotate a matrix by 90° or 180°  
* Flip or reflect images  
* Matrix reversal (row and column transformations)

### **Why It Matters**
These problems are common in interviews and test your ability to visualize transformations and manage in-place updates.

### **Practice Problems**
1. Search a 2D Matrix – *LeetCode #74*  
2. Rotate Image – *LeetCode #48*  
3. Reverse Matrix Rows – *GeeksforGeeks*

## Advanced Problem Solving

### **Topics**
* Flood Fill (DFS)
* Counting Islands (Connected Components)
* Unique Paths (Dynamic Programming)
* Minimum Path Sum (Dynamic Programming)

### **Why It Matters**
These problems evaluate recursion, boundary checking, and optimization through DP.  
Mastering them builds a bridge from basic matrix logic to real-world algorithmic challenges.

### **Practice Problems**
1. Flood Fill – *LeetCode #733*  
2. Number of Islands – *LeetCode #200*  
3. Unique Paths – *LeetCode #62*  
4. Minimum Path Sum – *LeetCode #64*

## Revision and Integration

### **Topics**
* Revisit all traversals and manipulations  
* Combine different techniques (e.g., traversal + transformation)  
* Debug boundary conditions  

### **Why It Matters**
Integration helps you connect patterns and think holistically.  
Most interview questions combine multiple traversal or transformation ideas.

### **Practice Problems**
1. Spiral print a matrix  
2. Rotate it by 90°  
3. Count islands  
4. Compute the minimum path sum
