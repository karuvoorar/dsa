# Recursion

A function that calls itself to solve a problem, dividing the problem to sub-problems, until it reaches a
**base condition** that further stops processing calls.

## Solving Parts
1. Base Case - to stop the on-going calls when this condition reaches.
2. Recurrence Solution - the function that calls itself with reduced input.
